                <h2>Founder & CEO</h2>
                <p>
                    Jake Boyles has been our CEO from day one. Jake has always been fascinated with the boating industry and being on the water. At the age of 15 he bought his first boat and the ride ever since has been amazing. Jake bought the marina 5 years ago and has worked to turn it around into a place where people all over the country come to buy and sell boats and to also experience the greatness that is Brookville Lake. Jake currently lives in Brookville and is very passionate about the boating community around town. You can contact Jake at jake.boyles@marrriba.com.

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>
                    Our company was founded in 1950 by a local Brookville native who loved the lake and all of the history behind it. He noticed that it wasn’t being fully utilized for its beauty so he created a small marina that would allow people on the lake to stop by and get supplies and snacks. As the years went on he expanded gradually into what we are today. We started selling boats in 1995 and starting taking trades in 2000. We also became official partners with our boat manufacturers in 2002 and have continued to benefit from that as well. We are now working with people from all over the country to meet their boating needs and expect the growth trend to continue.
